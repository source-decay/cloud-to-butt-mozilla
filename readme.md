# not-alt-right-mozilla

Derived from the work of DaveRandom's [cloud-to-butt](https://github.com/DaveRandom/cloud-to-butt-mozilla)
Firefox extension.

Created so that the Neo-Nazis can't hide from Firefox users. Plus, Chrome users shouldn't get to have all the fun :)

## Installing

**Make sure to enable installation of unsigned add-ons.**

about:config > I Understand the Risks > xpinstall.signatures.required is **_true_** by default - change this to
**_false_**

For the time being, go ahead and install the .xpi file directly.
When I have some time (soon&trade;) I will get this add-on signed and up
onto [AOM](addons.mozilla.com).

## To do

1. Transition to Web Extension for compatibilty with future Firefox versions
as Add-ons are slated to be deprecated by the end of 2017.
